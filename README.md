- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) ^10.0.0
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

Please note that you need mongo, the server and the client to run concurrently in different terminal session, in order to let them communicate

### Prepare your secret

Create a `.env` file in the server directory with at least the following lines (values to be changed at your discretion). You can find an example of a complete env configuration in the `example-env-file-server.env` file in the root directory.

```bash
PORT = 8000
PORTIO = 8001
NODE_ENV = dev
SECRET = demo
FS_URL = http://localhost:8000
```

Then, create another `.env` file in the client directory with at least the following line (values to be changed at your discretion). You can find an example of a complete env configuration in the `example-env-file-client.env` file in the client folder.

```bash
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY = demo
```
